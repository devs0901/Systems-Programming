Write a C program to do the following.
1. Using generator.c, utilize its generate() function to write random characters to a text file named Spam.txt.
2. Using <time.h>, time how long it takes for generate() to run.
3. When compiling the program, make sure the generator.c is also attached to the program or else the code wonâ€™t run.
4. Comment your code and execute.
